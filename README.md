1.Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects.
Window object:
•	It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy.
•	The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded inn that window.
Document object:
•	Each HTML document that gest loaded into a window becomes a document object.
•	The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, Javascript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page.
•	Access a document object either using window. Document property or using document object directly as window is global object.
The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior.
