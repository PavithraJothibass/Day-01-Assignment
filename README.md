# Theory Task: Web Protocols, JavaScript Objects, and Networking Concepts

## Overview

This project focuses on learning and documenting core concepts related to web protocols, JavaScript object representation, and networking fundamentals. The task involves writing comprehensive blogs on the topics mentioned below and conducting research to gain deeper insights into essential networking concepts.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Write a Blog on the Difference Between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
- **Objective**: Compare and contrast HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 in terms of performance, features, and technological improvements.
- **Key Points to Cover**:
  - Multiplexing in HTTP/2 vs. sequential requests in HTTP/1.1
  - Header compression in HTTP/2
  - Binary framing in HTTP/2 vs. text-based communication in HTTP/1.1
  - Server Push and Prioritization in HTTP/2
  - Performance advantages of HTTP/2 for modern web applications

### 2. Write a Blog About Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript
- **Objective**: Explore the concept of objects in JavaScript and how they are represented internally by JavaScript engines.
- **Key Points to Cover**:
  - JavaScript objects as key-value pairs
  - Different ways to access object properties (dot vs. bracket notation)
  - The prototype chain and inheritance in JavaScript
  - Hidden properties like `[[Prototype]]` and how JavaScript engines optimize object storage (e.g., hidden classes in V8)
  - How objects are manipulated and represented internally by the JavaScript engine

### 3. Read and Summarize Concepts: IP Address, Port, HTTP Methods, and MAC Address
- **Objective**: Understand the fundamental concepts of networking and how they apply to web development.
- **Topics to Research**:
  - **IP Address**: Learn about IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and how they identify devices on a network.
  - **Port**: Understand what a port is, its purpose in networking, and common ports used in web protocols.
  - **HTTP Methods**: Study common HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE and their role in RESTful APIs.
  - **MAC Address**: Learn about MAC addresses, their role in network communications, and how they differ from IP addresses.

## Structure

1. **Blogs Folder**:
   - Contains two markdown files:
     - `http1-vs-http2.md`: Blog post detailing the differences between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2.
     - `js-objects-internal-representation.md`: Blog post explaining how objects are internally represented in JavaScript.
   
2. **Research Notes**:
   - `networking-concepts.md`: A markdown file summarizing the key networking concepts youâ€™ve studied (IP Address, Port, HTTP Methods, and MAC Address).
